# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic and self learning purposes.

## Contents

- ### Exploratory Data Analysis
  - [Yulu - Business Case Study](https://github.com/ankurkumar-ml/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/business-case-yulu-hypothesis-testing.ipynb): 
    Performed exploratory data analysis and **hypothesis testing** to identify which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles. <br>
  **Hypothesis tests:** Chi‐sqaure test, 2‐sample ttest, ANOVA test
  
  - [Walmart - Business Case Study](https://github.com/ankurkumar-ml/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/walmart-confidence-interval-and-clt.ipynb): Analyzed the customer purchase behavior against the customer's gender
and various other factors to help the business make better decisions.
 Used univariate & bivariate analysis to understand individual variables
and relationship between them. Used **Central Limit Theorem** and **Confidence Intervals** to calculate the
range of mean amount spend based on Gender, Age etc.

  - [Netflix Data Exploration](https://github.com/ankurkumar-ml/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/netflix-data-exploration-and-visualisation.ipynb): Analyzed the data and generated the insights that could help Netflix in deciding which type of shows/movies to produce and how they can grow the business in different countries. Created recommendations for the Netflix based on the EDA like top 10
countries where most of the movies are released, Top 10 most popular
genres etc.

- ### Deep Learning
  - [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/ankurkumar-ml/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/sentiment-analysis-using-lstm-pytorch.ipynb): Developed a sentiment analysis model on the IMDB reviews dataset to
predict the sentiment of the movie review using recurrent neural
networks **(LSTM)** with **Pytorch**.

   - [Email Classification using word embeddings & RNNs](https://github.com/ankurkumar-ml/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/enron-email-classification-using-word-embeddings.ipynb): Developed an email classification model using **word embeddings (word2vec, Glove)** and recurrent neural networks (**RNNs, LSTM**) achieving **81%** validation accuracy using **Glove embeddings**.

  - [Text rotation detection](https://github.com/ankurkumar-ml/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/text-rotation-detection.ipynb): Developed a **CNN** model to predict the rotation of text image using **vgg16 network** and Keras, achieving **88.64%** validation accuracy.

  - [Face Mask Detection](https://github.com/ankurkumar-ml/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/face-mask-detection.ipynb): Created a face mask detection model to detect if a person is wearing mask or not using **resnet50 convolutional neural network** achieving **95.95%** accuracy on the validation data.

  - [Malaria Detection](https://github.com/ankurkumar-ml/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/detecting-malaria-using-inceptionnet.ipynb): Trained a **CNN** model on cell's images of malaria (having and not having) using **InceptionNet** and **Keras** achieving **96.09%** validation accuracy.


- ### Machine Learning
  - [Email Classification](https://github.com/ankurkumar-ml/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/enron-email-classification-using-machine-learning.ipynb): Compared different machine learning models to model **text classification** problem using different text representation techniques like **bag of words** representation, **TFidf** represenation and calculated the accuracy and training time of each algorithm.
